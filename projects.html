            studying the applications of Software and Hardware in the realm of FPGA Design during allocation. This
            research project is letting me take a step towards leading my own project in a complicated realm of hardware

            After gaining a solid background on the MLIR Compiler, I was able to assist in the development of our own
            MLIR Compiler. My job in the Computer Systems Labratory (CSL) for the next three semesters would revolve
            around testing and developing the compiler through intrduction of new features, tracking data through its
            evolution and creating test benches that exposes possible errors along with serving as a baseline to compare
            to existing compilers.

            to create a autonomous robot capable of microplastic filtration on the shores of beaches. When joining
            Nexus, I had joined the Electrical Subteam, where I learned in great detail of technical skills with coding
            in Python, data abstraction from sensors, and the development of a PCB. After taking ownership on the team
            and growing into my role, I was chosen to be the Full Team Lead for Nexus during my Sophomore Spring and
            Junior year. I became lead during the transistion period from a club to a offical Cornell Project Team. This
            experience paired with the Cornell Engineering Leadership Program fostered my skills in leading engineering
            teams along with gaining skills in project management, team dynamics, and becoming knowledgeable in other
            subteams. Upon completing my tenure as Team Lead, I transistioned into a mentorship role for the new members
            of Electrical Subteam. Our project is near completion for our first prototype!

          <p>At Cornell, the Selander Center offers the Cornell Engineering Leadership Program. This program focuses on
            two major things, the development of the person taking charge and their ability to control the teams they
            work in to work as effectivily as possible. In the ELP, I had the opportunity to work with Morgan, Erik and
            Ruth to create an activity called CUBeeHappy which our main goal was to find ways to spark joy on the
            Cornell Campus through small and large acts of kindness. Some ways our group approached this was through
            handing out snowcones, cookie fundraising, along with our big event which consisted of hosting a comedy show
            on campus with over 200 attendees. This show invited numerous comedy groups, along with offering open mic
            for students who were interested. CUBeeHappy taught me the skills of finding the stakes of members, planning
            large events, handling assumptions.</p>

          <p>The Cornell Animal Health Hackathon is the first Hackathon I have participated in! This Hackathon lasted 3
            days and its purpose was to innovate a solution to a problem in the Animal Health Industry including
            pigmented animals, shortages in vet profession, specialty case back log, high volume testing, and more. I
            had originally participated in this event as it was suggested from my NBA 6650 class: Strategic Management
            of Technology, however this was one of my favorite experiences at Cornell.
            <br>
            Our team, <a href="https://georgem58.github.io/Uplift/" target="_blank">Up Lift</a>, focused on a solution
            to
            to assist in animal recovery without the physical demands of
            caretaking, address the shortage of veterinary staff, and explore ways to make it more accessible for
            consumers. Our idea was similar to that of a Hoyer lift that would support a dog's entire weight either in
            ACL recovery or post-anesthesia to provide range of motion and mobility for the dog if it wants to move,
            while also providing simplicity for caretakers to maneuver these animals without strain.
            <br>
            Though our idea did not move onto the final round, this experience taught me so much about the animal health
            by working with students in different dicsciplines, and how to work in a team to innovate a solution
            through brainstorming, prototyping, and pitching. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the design process
            of a product and tailoring it to a particular audiance and their needs!

            For the Cornell Digital Agriculture Hackathon, our group had came in wanting to create a project that
            revolved around water sensors and data collection. This idea was very vague which eventually took time for
            us to narrow down and find a solution. Our group, "Hydrolytics", focused on a solution to assist farmers
            in solving regional issues of high salinity and low pH in their soil. By providing farmers with real time
            data through monitoring their water througb a sensor called "FarmFlow", along with the ability simply access
            their data, analyize trends in their regional area, and provide them with actionable insights and
            reccomendations through our machine learning model, we aim to help farmers make informed decisions about
            crop health.

          <p>My partner and I designed and programmed a Bluetooth-controlled RC car using an Arduino FRDM Board. Our
            design takes input from a Bluetooth controller (in our case a XBox Controller) and the controls are mapped
            on our laptop through Pygame. We then use the Arduino as a receiver between the computer and FRDM board
            where controls are mapped to GPIO functionality and PWM to our motor wheels. By using H-Bridges, we are able
            to go in multiple directions. See our

            Projector, and a Raspberry
            Pi. By getting depth values in the sand and filtering out values not in range, we normalize data points and
            perform a linear mapping of RBG colors. We made use of a Linux open source library, OpenKinect to abstract
            the values from the Kinect. This library also makes use of all four cores making use all all effective
            hardware, letting us run nearly in real-time. See our
